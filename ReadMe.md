# Churn Prediction
The essence of a churn prediction model is to avoid losing too much revenue.
For a first-case churn analysis, we will want to check that churn rate is not same or higher than customer acquisition rate. For a continued analysis, the business KPI sets the churn rate limit.

The data in this study is a quarterly report from a fictive telecom company that provides home phone service and internet subscriptions. We will treat the data as a first-case churn analysis study. We inspect and explore the data to understand the factors that affect churn, train a model to predict churn, test the model and verify accuracy.

This repository contains a [Telco_Churn_Prediction]() notebook that explains the model.

The model was deployed with Streamlit and can be accessed [here](). If the app has gone to sleep, simply wake it up.
